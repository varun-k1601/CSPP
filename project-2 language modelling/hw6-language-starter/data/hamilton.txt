though , in reviewing the incidents of my administration , I am unconscious of intentional error , I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors .
I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will view them with indulgence ; and that after forty - five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal , the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion , as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest .
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow - citizens , the benign influence of good laws under a free government , the ever - favorite object of my heart , and the happy reward , as I trust of our mutual cares , labors , and danger .
